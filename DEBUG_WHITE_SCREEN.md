# üîç Debug White Screen Issue

## Current Status: Testing Basic React

I've simplified everything to the most basic React setup possible.

### What I Changed:
1. **Removed all imports** except React and ReactDOM
2. **Created super simple component** using React.createElement
3. **Added fallback HTML** with loading message
4. **Added JavaScript console logging**

### Debug Steps:

#### Step 1: Check Browser Console
Open browser dev tools (F12) and look for:
- JavaScript errors
- Network errors
- Console messages

#### Step 2: Check Network Tab
Look for:
- Failed resource loads
- 404 errors for JS/CSS files
- CORS errors

#### Step 3: Check if HTML Loads
You should see either:
- "React is Working! üéâ" (if React loads)
- "Loading your dream app..." (if React doesn't load)
- "React Loading Issue" (after 3 seconds if React fails)

#### Step 4: Local vs Deployed
Test both:
- Local development: `cd client && npm start`
- Deployed version on Vercel

### Common Causes:
1. **Build errors** - Check build logs
2. **Missing files** - Check if all files deployed
3. **Path issues** - Check if assets load correctly
4. **JavaScript errors** - Check console for errors
5. **Memory issues** - Try clearing browser cache

### Next Steps:
Once we see what's happening, we can:
1. Fix the root cause
2. Gradually add back components
3. Restore full functionality

Let me know what you see in the browser!
