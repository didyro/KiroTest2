# ðŸ”§ Restore Full App

## Current Status: âœ… Testing Minimal Version

If the minimal version works (shows login screen and success after login), follow these steps to restore full functionality:

### Step 1: Restore Full App
```bash
# Replace App.js with the backup
cp client/src/App.backup.js client/src/App.js
```

### Step 2: If White Screen Returns
The issue is likely in one of these components:
- `DreamInput.js`
- `DreamInterpretation.js` 
- `DreamJournal.js`
- `UserProfile.js`

### Step 3: Debug Process
1. Add each component back one by one
2. Test after each addition
3. Find the problematic component
4. Add inline styles as fallback

### Step 4: Common Issues
- Missing CSS classes
- Undefined props
- Component import errors
- localStorage parsing errors

The Auth component now has inline styles as fallback, so login should always work!
